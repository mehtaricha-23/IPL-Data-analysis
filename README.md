# IPL-Data-analysis
# IPL Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes IPL match data from 2008 to 2023 using Python libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. The goal is to derive meaningful insights and visualize key trends in IPL history.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of two CSV files:
1. **match_data.csv** - Contains details of each match (winner, teams, scores, etc.)
2. **match_info_data.csv** - Provides additional match metadata

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for **missing values** and handled them accordingly.
- Removed **duplicate records**.
- Converted **data types** where necessary for better analysis.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### ✅ Toss Impact on Match Results
- Analyzed whether the **team winning the toss** has a higher chance of winning the match.
- Visualized the toss winners vs. match winners to identify patterns.
- Used **bar plots and pie charts** to showcase the trends.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Analyze the **most successful teams** based on win percentage.
- Identify the **most consistent players** (top scorers, wicket-takers).
- Compare performance when **batting first vs. chasing**.
- Determine the **best venues** for batting/bowling.
